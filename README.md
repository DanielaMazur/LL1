# LL1

The purpose of this laboratory work is to implement the LL1 parser

In the LL1_parser.py is the implementation and test.txt and v12.txt are input files with grammar for testing the algorithm

Note: The small letter 'e' is considered as empty string, so if the grammar contains the terminal 'e' consider replacing it with another letter.
